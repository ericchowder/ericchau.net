            Virtual Reality Surgery Simulator (VRSS) was the capstone project I completed with two fellow electrical
            engineering students.<br>
            The idea of the project was to simulate surgery in virtual reality in a budget friendly way. <br>
            The VR environment was created in Unity and the gloves were created with Arduino Megas. <br>

        <p>
        This LED Prism was originally a group project for a Queen's course COCA 201 (Computing Creative Art), however ended <br>
        up being cancelled due to COVID-19. I decided to continue the project as a neat side project to utilize some of my <br>
        computer engineering knowledge I learned in school. <br>
        The LED Prism consists of an Arduino Uno, a custom soldered LED Prism, a few resistors, and a custom Android APK used <br>
        for controlling the LED Prism. This allows different patterns to light up on the LED Prism!
