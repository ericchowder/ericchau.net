                    I am a recently graduated Computer Engineer
                    from Ottawa, Ontario. I have a passion for design in 
                    technology, and thought Computer Engineering would offer
                    the exposure I desired for a broad range of technologies.

                    I enjoy playing hockey with friends and snowboarding (when I can), and also volunteer
                    as a cat foster for the Ottawa Humane Society! I recently took a motorcycle
                    training course and plan on getting my full M license this summer (currently
                    M2)! I can be pretty silly at times if you really get to know me :)

                    I initially went to school at Carleton University in Ottawa, but wanted to try to live
                    on my own for a bit so I transferred to Queen's University in Kingston after my first
                    year. I am really glad I did as I made some really great friends there and enjoyed being
                    able to live on my own for the first time.

                    My original graduating class was in 2018 (graduated high school in 2014), so I received my
                    iron ring in spring of 2018 along with some solid life-long friends. My dad eve drove up from
                    Ottawa for the occasion to ring me as he is also graduated engineering (electrical) in
                    Canada. How cool is that?! However, I decided to do internship in order to gain some workplace
                    experience and also considered doing exchange at the time. I spent a year (2018-2019) working
                    at Neptec Technologies Corp (NTC). I learned a lot about general workplace operations and workflow.
                    In 2019, I came back to Queen's to take some interesting non-engineering courses I never had the chance
                    to take before like Game Design and Computing Creative Art! I had a ton of fun with those courses
                    and glad I took the route I did. Really looking forward to what the future has in store for me!
