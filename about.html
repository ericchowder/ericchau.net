                    I'm a recently graduated Computer Engineer
                    from Ottawa, Ontario. I have a passion for design in
                    <br>
                    technology, and thought Computer Engineering was the 
                    way for general exposure.

                    I enjoy playing hockey with friends and snowboarding (when I can), and I'm also volunteer
                    as a cat foster<br>for the Ottawa Humane Society! I recetnly took a motorcycle
                    training course and plan on getting my full M<br>license this summer (currently
                    M2)! I can pretty silly at times if you really get to know me :)

                    I initially went to school at Carleton University in Ottawa, but wanted to try to live
                    on my own for<br>a bit so I transferred to Queen's University in Kingston after my first
                    year. I'm really glad I did as I made<br>some really great friends there and enjoyed being
                    able to live on my own for the first time.

                    My original graduating class was in 2018 (graduated high school in 2014), so I received my
                    iron ring in<br>spring of 2018 along with some solidside life-long friends. My dad drove up from
                    Ottawa for the occasion to ring me<br>as he is also graduated engineering (electrical) in
                    Canada. How cool is that?! However, I decided to do internship in<br>order to gain some workplace
                    experience and also was considering doing exchange at the time. I spent a year<br>(2018-2019)
                    working at Neptec Technologis Corp (NTC). I learned a lot about the general the general workplace,
                    and<br>came back to Queen's to take some interesting non-engineering courses I never had the chance
                    to take before like<br>Game Design and Computing Creative Art! I had a ton of fun with those courses
                    and glad I took the route I did. Really<br>looking forward to what the future has in store for me!
