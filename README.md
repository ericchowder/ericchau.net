Repository for my personal website. Can also be accessed via ericchau.net via http forwarding.

## Background

Initially created for exploring React library/framework and introduction to front end. This site was designed from scratch in order to explore vanilla HTML/CSS from ground up, and also so it felt like it was 100% my own work.

### Prerequisites

Languages used so far:

```
- HTML
- CSS
```

### To-do's

```
- finish up resume, about me, and contact tabs
- add logo
- mobile friendly
- implement bootstrap
- implement react
```
